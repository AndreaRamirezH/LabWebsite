# Lab Wiki

## How to add an entry

First clone the respository from the lab website to your local computer.
In the terminal, first navigate to the folder where you want the folder of the website to end up in.
Then do:
```
git clone https://github.com/AndreaRamirezH/LabWebsite
```

You will download the folder containing everything needed to build the website.
One subfolder is named `wiki/`.
You can simply add Markdown files to this wiki.
For instructions on how to write Markdown, see [this page](https://franklinjl.org/syntax/markdown/).

It is possible to group posts that share a theme together in a subfolder of `wiki/`, as desired.

After you have written your post, push the repository to GitHub by doing
```
git push origin
```
or something similar,
and your post will be included in the wiki.
That's it!
